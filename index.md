# Welcome reader

My name is Jorge M.G., I am an undergraduate aerospace engineering student
really interested in scientific computing with applications on the orbital
mechanics field. Contributing to open-source projects has been my main source
of information during the last years. I have learned lots of tools and good
code practices such as version control systems, CI, packaging, testing,
documentation...

This website holds not only my professional information but different articles
on orbital mechanics, programming and interesting projects that reader might
find useful for daily tasks.

If you find any errata, want to publish something or just want to contac me,
please senfd me an plain text email to jorge@on-orbit.dev.

## Interesting links

In this section you will find a set of links to other blogs, websites or web
content related to computer science, engineering and orbital mechanics.

- **Celestial mechanics and dynamics astronomy journal:** this is probably the
    most famous journal about orbital mechanics. The problem is that you
    require either to be subscribed to the journal or have access granted
    because or University or other institution in order to read the articles.
    *I am toatlly against authors who publish their content witout including a
    free-reading link of their article. Science might be linked to bussiness
    but should not be a bussiness itself.*

* **NASA Technical Report Server:** it is an amazing web where you can find not
    only actual and altest internal NASA papers but also old ones. Access to
    reports is completely free. During the last years, I have been making use
    of this tool for downloading old papers on Kepler's and Lambert's
    algorithms together with atmospherical modelling.
