    It is not easy to deal with distance and love and the same time; a week or
    two without seeing her might be feasible but it gets a little bit difficult
    as pandemic situation gets more complex. Furthermore, final exams dates are
    getting close together with summer season.

    But we have a secret weapon... a lot of cool plans for the holidays! And not
    only during this summer we are thinking about winter also. This post is
    dedicated to my girlfriend, who is taking her finals after a surgery. Love
    you Mar√≠a!

# üìù Pandemic love

It was March the 10th when we said goodbye to each other in front of the metro
station. At that moment nobody of us had in mind the fact that the situation was
going to evolve the way it has done. But here we are!

We have been calling each other almost every single day, talking about our
daily life, sending memes or even watching movies! This girl has impressed me a
lot since I meet her one Saturday afternoon at the Plaza del 2 de Mayo: she
shows maturity, takes care about little Loup when I am outside home and even
tries to cook sometimes (she is still practicing this last skill, sorry Maria).

I really have tried to smooth the situation and make it more cool by writing her
small letters, making some 5-year-old-kid-skilled-drawings or posting this
article, which hope she likes it.

It is expected that this situation will finish in less than a month. At the
moment, that is the established date when all Spanish citizens will authorized
to drive again and freely move and travel. It will be summer by then and the
second round final exams will take place at my university. I hope to see and
kiss her then.

During the holidays I would like to visit her village (or at least going to the
Feria), and see her dressed as a bailaora/gitana (is that the word, Meri?). I
want her to visit mine one too, so we can go to the beach and the airfield.

We miss you so much, Mar√≠a! Both of us (Loup and me) want to see you as soon as
possible, go dancing with you and kiss you! üê∫‚ù§Ô∏è
