resume:

    Four years ago I started coding in Python and switched to Linux. My
    programming skills have increase dramatically since then. Although I
    consider myself really fluent at Python and make use of this beautiful
    language almost every single day, it is time to move out of my confort zone
    by learning the language that enables the snake to be alive; the C
    programming language!

    In this post I will stablish my tasks all the different objectives I would
    like to achieve during this summer while learning this old but powerful
    programming language.

# üìù Learning the C programming language

During the following months, I am planning to master the C programming language.
After four years of Python (which is a beautiful language I make use of every
single day) I would like to learn its mother language (C) in order to finally
extend Python with it.

I am going to make use of the following material in order to increase my
knowledge on the topic:

* "The C programming language", by Kernighan and Ritchie. This is probably the
    most famous book on the language and one of the first programming ones to
    include the "Hello World!" example. In addition, the authors are the
    creators of the C language and the ANSI standard one.

* "Curso de programaci√≥n C/C++", Fco. Javier Ceballos. This books contains deep
    examples on how to use the language. I bough some months ago a second hand
    copy by a ridiculous small price!

* "Modern C", by Jens Gustedt. It is an amazing free book which can be
    downloaded [here](https://modernc.gforge.inria.fr/).

In addition to previous resources, I would like to work not only into small
personal projects but also try to solve for the [Euler
Project](https://projecteuler.net/) problems.  They will be tremendously useful
when practicing the language in order to test my skills.

Hope to write a post for the next week and see a little bit of progress with
this. Thank you for reading!.
