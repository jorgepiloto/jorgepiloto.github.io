resume:

    Have you ever start reading a paper, report or research and realized that it
    is impossible to reproduce just because author's data is not properly
    defined or linked? Have you tried to contact but they lost or just do not
    want to share the content? Why some journals allow this kind of content?

    Reproducible research is mandatory to make sure that your publication can be
    properly checked by other scientists around the world but not all people
    cares about this.

# üìù On reproducible research and sci-journals

Have you ever start reading a paper, report or research and realized that
that it is impossible to reproduce just because author's data is not
properly defined or linked? Have you tried to contact but they lost or just
do not want to share the content? Why some journals publish this kind of
content?

**Reproducible research is mandatory to make sure that your publication can be
properly checked by other scientists around the world but not all people cares
about this.**

In the post you will learn about the Reproducible Research Manifesto and
which tools you can make use to protect but also good-sharing your papers.

### The forgotten scientific method

When you want to solve for a problem and guess the physical reasons that
justify/explain what is going on, you must apply this iterative simple method:

1. Identify the problem.
2. Heavy research on the topic.
3. Make an hypothesis.
4. Run all tests: adjust hypothesis if necessary till convergence is
   achieved. Test procedures might change due to new hypothesis. Results should be
   reproducible by others; no place for lucky strikes!
5. Formulate results.

Most critical part in previous workflow might the fourth step: keep testing till
your results converge not only once, but several times. This will ensure you
have achieved the right hypothesis and others can simulate your results in their
labs and facilities. And remember:

**If some initial conditions are necessary to carry out the experiment you have
to share them. Otherwise it will be impossible to reproduce and achieve the
results you claim.**


### Reproducible research

This term was created by Jon Claerbout who is a geophysics professor (see first
reference). The term explains on its own: the idea behind others to be able to
achieve the same results as the original research. Reproducible research is
usually linked to software research.
