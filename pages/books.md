I love books, especially those related to science content. Although most of my
readings at the end of the day are related to technical content, sometimes I
like to read literature ones. In addition, phylosophy is another topic I
sometimes like to read about.

### Computer science and programming books

Most of the following books deal with basic programming or interesting
applications with an specific language. The books shown in this section are the
ones that I have enjoyed the most while learning the skill the promoted.

<br>

<!-- THE C PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE -->

style="width:150px; height:200px; margin-right: 20px">
**The C programming language**, by Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M.

Ritchie it is one of the most famous programming books of all the time and the
first one to define the so-common "Hello World!" programms. This book assumes
that you have a minimum coding knowledge in the sense of conditional statements,
loops and other basic such us compilation tasks. So far so good, it introduces
in a UNIX system oriented way the C programming language.

If you are planning to get a copy of the book, I strongly recommend you to do it
from a second hand books website. Although this book is amazing, the prize for a
new copy is (in my opinion) too high for a best seller programming book.

<!-- COMPUTATIONAL MODELING USING C -->
<img class="imgleft" align="left" src="{{

height:200px; margin-right: 20px">
**Introduction to Computational Modeling Using C and Open-Source Tools**, by
Jose M. Garrido.

This is a great book if you are planning to use the C programming language in a
scientifical approach. It contains a lot of examples on how to apply this
programming language on solving equations and also a brief tutorials on the GSL
(GNU Scientific Library) library for dealing with vector, matrices, ODEs and PDE
problems.

For the moment, I am still reading this book and learning C in deep. Again, its
main problem, is the price you have to pay for a soft cover copy... Hope to find
a second hand copy for this one!

<!-- BUILDING PYTHON SKILLS -->
<img class="imgleft" align="left" src="{{
site.url}}/resources/books/python_skills.jpg" style="width:150px; height:200px;
margin-right: 20px">
**Building skills in Python**, by Steven F. Lott. Although 

This is one of my favourite Python books because two main reasons: it contains a
lot of simple but powerful examples and also shows real world applications, in
this case simulation of Casino Games.

It shows the beauty of this powerful language when creating, for example, a
class that builds up all the possible cards of a deck. In addition, reader will
be proof that Casino always has more chances of winning money than the player.
Since the book was first published in 2009, it might be difficult to find a new
copy; this is the main disadvantage for this book.

<!-- ORBITAL MECHANICS BOOKS SECTION -->
### Orbital mechanics and astrodynamics books

This section shows a collection of my favourite related orbital mechanics books.
Most of them are really famous and reference ones in this field. You might have
to refer to specialliced libraries to find copies for this publications.

<br>

<!-- Fundamentals of astrodynamics -->
<img class="imgleft" align="right" src="{{
site.url}}/resources/books/fundamentals_astrodynamics.jpg" style="width:150px;
height:230px; margin-left: 20px">
**Fundamentals of Astrodynamics and Applications**, by David A. Vallado.

Without any doubt, this is the reference book for orbital mechanics topic. It
covers a lot of topics: from basics two-body problem till mission analysis. The
fact that Vallado provides pseudo-code and orients this publications towards
software development (somehow) makes it a really powerful item.

You might want to refer to its official website,
[Celestrack](https://celestrak.com/) for more information on this book, its
content and addition info. Price is worth it for such a great publication.
However, some algorithms might be updated and differ from the original fourht
publication in the website. I must say that this book is so deep in content that
have not finished its reading yet. Consider it as a quick reference manual, be
sure you will use it this way, I promise.

<!-- Handbook of Satellite Orbits: From Kepler to GPS -->
**Handbook of Satellite Orbits: From Kepler to GPS**, by Michel Capderou.
<img class="imgleft" align="right" src="{{

height:200px; margin-left: 20px">

Amazing book with beutiful figures, in particular those ones related with ground
track plots. It contains a lot of orbit examples together with a deep
explanation on their design and applications.

The final chapters of the book are oriented towards orbits around other solar
system bodies rather than the Earth. Although initial sections for this book
introduce reader in the basics for orbital mechanics, it is better to understand
this book as a practical applications for everything that Vallado covers in his
book.

<!-- LITERATURE AND NARRATIVE BOOKS -->
### Narrative and phriloshopy books

Some books in this section are originally written in Spanish, my mother
language. As previous sections, reader does not need to agree the books placed
here are interesting or "the best ones of all times".

<br>

<!-- El lazarillo de Tormes -->
**El lazarillo de Tormes**, by unknown author.
<img class="imgleft" align="left" src="{{
site.url}}/resources/books/lazarillo.jpg" style="width:150px;
height:200px; margin-right: 20px">

This is my favorite literature book from far. I use it as a life guide
(sometimes) and it is interesting to see that some of its contents apply even in
today's world.

I will not resume its content: it is better if you read it! And actually, since
this is a Spanish classic of literature, it should be easy to find a copy of it,
even online free.
