<p>My name is Jorge Martínez Garrido and I am an undergraduate aerospace engineer.
After joining university, I became interested in scientific computing applied to
the aerospace world, in particular to orbital mechanics branch.</p>
<p>While in my free time, I like to contribute to open-source projects related with
previous sciences or develop my own codes. Most of those are completely written
in Python, a programming language I feel very comfortable with. Nevertheless, I
have experience with Matlab and C too. You might also find some of my projects
being related with flight simulation gauges or templates for academical writing.
Anyway, the common thing between all of them is its open-source nature. The
only way this world will become truly free is through knowledge sharing.</p>
<p>In 2019, I applied to the Google Summer of Code coding program. I was selected
for the poliastro project, a pure Python library which provides an API for
solving common orbital mechanics problems. Juan Luis Cano Rodríguez, the
original and main author of the project, helped me a lot since I joined
the project. At the moment, I am one of its core developers. By the end
of 2020, the project was granted with NumFOCUS support for developing a
validation repository to check most critical software features.</p>
<p>But not everything in my life is related to programming. I also like to have fun
with my dog. Loup is a border collie, a very smart and active dog. He knows
several tricks and really enjoys going outside to make new friends. Sometimes, I
envy his life: we (humans) should learn a lot from animals and stop caring about
non-vital things that society makes us think to be important.</p>
<p>I used to be a light sport aircraft pilot but after some time, decided not to
keep flying. It is not I no longer like aviation, but preferred to focus and
direct all my efforts towards other abilities. The figure below these lines is a
landscape of Aeroclub of Castellón, the airfield where I learned how to fly
aircraft. I really miss spending my weekends there: flying in the
mornings, having launch with the rest of the pilots and reading aviation
journals in the control tower till the day was over...</p>

<p>Back in 2018 I also got interested by Ham Radio and started studying for the
official exam. Finally, I was able to pass it and got my call sign: EA4GXZ. The
truth is that because my lack of equipment, I am not able to make contacts from
home. Therefore, my activities related with this hobby can be considered null.
I hope one day to have an small radio station so this situation can change!</p>
<p>Finally, by the end of 2019 I decided to setup up this website to have a place
were sharing my content. It is true there are plenty of platforms for blogging
and carrying out this task in a more easy way, but if you always take the easy
path, you end up learning nothing at all. Therefore, I encourage you to navigate
through all the different available resources from this website and I hope you
enjoy them.</p>

        The New validation framework for poliastro proposal was accepted by the
        NumFocus organization under the small development grants program. During
        the next four months, both Juan Luis and me will be working to tests the
        accuracy of poliastro's routines against similar open-source projects.
